Contributing
-------------------------------
If you would like to contribute I would be happy to receive help in a large
number of areas. Including:
* Testing
* Documentation (MacHg has some documentation but it would be nice to have much
  more complete documentation.)
* Cocoa coding (Lots of potential enhancements here)
* Mercurial extension writing (There are a few extensions I could use help with:
  for example, around permissibility of dragging and dropping in history
  rewriting, etc.)
* Translating (Especially those who have experience using Apple's polyglot tool,
  etc.)
* Web designers (There are a number of enhancements to be made to web pages,
  wikis, etc.)
* Graphic design (Icon design, etc.)
