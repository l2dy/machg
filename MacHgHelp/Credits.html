<h1>MacHg</h1>

<p>MacHg is free for private non-commercial use, but all donations are of course appreciated.<br />
</p>

<p> However, if you use MacHg in a commercial setting, the author of this package humbly asks that you make a donation of US$20 per seat. MacHg is 'DonationWare'. This donation is not compulsory, but it would sure help defray my costs of developing MacHg which you are using right now. The full license details are given below.</p>

<p>MacHg has taken some considerable time to develop, please allow me to continue its development and support the author by donating. All monies will go towards new features, enhancements, hosting costs, and bug fixes.</p>
